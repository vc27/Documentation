- click "+ New API Key" or edit the existing default api key
- edit the description with domainname.com this is to help distinguish the api key in case a second key is created in the future. This is important for debugging when a second api key is used, do not skip this step you will hate yourself later for not taking the 2 seconds to do it.
- copy the api key to your clipboard
- go to domainname.com/wp-admin and install the wpmandrill
- https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmandrill/
- got to the mandrill settings page and enter your api key
- enter the following values with the same email address as the "Sending Domain" from previous steps: FROM Name, FROM Email, Reply-To Email. The example above use "info@domainname.com". This is very important, you must use an email that can receive email and uses the "Sending Domain". Failure to do so will eventually cause your mandrill account to error out.
