Workflow
====================

Notes:
--------------------
The following outline is based on a production environment where the developer is brought in after the preliminary site outlines and design have been completed and approved.

Outline:
--------------------

### Design files
- Collect all design files from designer.
- Designs should be declared approved or not approved.
- Note: From time to time designs will receive an update after approval, if this is the case than an email should be sent to the developer to check in and make sure they are working from the latest version.
- If designer has appropriate time they should attempt to clean and organize the internal structure of the files.

### Fonts
- Designer should be using fonts that are accessible via the web.
- Fontâ€™s should be sent with the design files either zipped or linked to their online location.

### Kickoff meeting
- A kickoff meeting of various proportions should precede the construction of any project.
- Kickoff meeting can be ran by anyone knowledgeable enough to translate the project.
- Note: This is to allow translation of design and instructions on various aspects of the project.

### Tech specs
- It is best to build an outline of tech specs during the kickoff meeting.
- This outline will be referred to throughout the project as a reference point for project completion and time projections.

### Server Location
- If the project requires a server or domain name it should be determined at this point.
- Production can begin without this item, but will not be able to be completed.
- Some server setups and server info collection can take a long time, the process should begin as soon as possible.

### Code Specs: Building Block: Bootstrap Responsive
- Bootstrap responsive css is the preferred template for adding responsive css.
- Designs may require minuscule alterations to accommodate, but for the most part it will not change.

### CSS: Style guide
- Construction begins with accumulating all the various fonts, colors, buttons, icons.
- Create a style guide from accumulated items.

### Construction: Default items first
- Construction begins with the most default item available and moves forward from that point. An example would be a static single page.
- Note: This gives the developer a chance to style all the basics before digging into the custom styles.

### CSS: Reusable groupings
- CSS should follow a pattern of reusable .classes accompanied by a parent #id.
- Assessment of the design should present all possible areas where reusable elements will exist.

### HTML: Reusable element
- HTML should follow a pattern of use that allows easy recognition from one designer to the next.

### Order of html construction
- Single page layouts
- Archive page layouts
- Custom page layouts
- Custom functionality
